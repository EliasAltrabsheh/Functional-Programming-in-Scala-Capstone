# Functional-Programming-in-Scala-Capstone
Functional Programming in Scala Capstone


## About the specialisation

This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. Functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark.

A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.

## About the course

In the final capstone project you will apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.

You will implement a complete application processing several gigabytes of data. This application will show interactive visualizations of the evolution of temperatures over time all over the world.

The development of such an application will involve:
 — transforming data provided by weather stations into meaningful information like, for instance, the average temperature of each point of the globe over the last ten years 
 — then, making images from this information by using spatial and linear interpolation techniques 
 — finally, implementing how the user interface will react to users’ actions.

## Syllabus 



**Project overview - Week 1 :** Get an overview of the project and all the information to get started. Transform data provided by weather stations into meaningful information.

**Raw data display - Week 2 :** Transform temperature data into images, using various interpolation techniques.

**Interactive visualization - Week 3 :** Generate images compatible with most Web-based mapping libraries.

**Data manipulation - Week 4 :** Get more meaning from your data: compute temperature deviations compared to normals.

**Value-added information visualization- Week 5 :** Generate images using bilinear interpolation.

**Interactive user interface - Week 6 :** Generate images using bilinear interpolation.



**Assignment deatails are broken down in each week's folder.**
